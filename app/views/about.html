			<p>I'm a creative front‑end developer with 5+ years of professional experience.</p>
			<p>I develop compelling designs that spring to life using transition and animations, using the best frameworks available today for fully interactive and responsive websites and apps. I’m passionate about the power of colours and shapes in developing a great design, and JavaScript offers me endless fascinating possibilities.</p>

			<p>In my spare time, I like to doodle, as well as work on all sorts of experimental development projects to see where they go.</p>
